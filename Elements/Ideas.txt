Small Isotope Decay Probability Generator (Small I.D.P. Generator) - 1000w
Large Isotope Decay Probability Generator (Large I.D.P. Generator) - 2000w
A machine capable of effecting and manuiplting the half life decay of the binge and long lived radioisotope fuel that runs the generator. 
At the flip of the switch, the machine is able to manuiplate this decay to generate energy. The inner working of the generator are a complete mystery.
